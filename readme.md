# PolyTheremin Software  

## Overview  

This repository contains the software implementation of the [PolyTheremin project](https://github.com/MiCyg/PolyTheremin) (Currently under development). The code has been tested on my [testing platform](https://github.com/MiCyg/PolyTheremin_Hardware), connected to four metal antennas.  

This project implements a polyphonic theremin using the RP2040 microcontroller, with FreeRTOS and CMSIS-DSP library for matrix operations.

## Functionalities

- [X] Detect fingers by antennas
- [X] Scale frequency to music range
- [X] Generate sound depend to fingers distances
- [X] Use button to change sound
- [ ] Auto scaling
- [ ] Uploading custom waves
- [ ] Increase detectors distance

## Frequency detector

Frequency detection made by counting timer between each signal period. On change a signal state, the counter starts counting to next rising edge. Then, interrupt copy counter value to proper pointer in memory.

In other way, DMA get values from this pointer to make input buffer. After end dma transmission, them calls a interrupt every `FREQ_DET_DMA_BUFFER_NUM` numbers of transfers. 
Buffer created in that way can be averaged and analysing to proper oscillators frequencies.

## Capacitive Touch Calibration  

Each antenna generates a digital square wave signal with a frequency ranging from 400 kHz to 600 kHz. These signals are processed by the `het_generator` module, which quantizes them to create a beating signal with a beat frequency above 10 kHz.  

To calibrate, measure the base frequency of each antenna and define `HET_GENX_FREQ` for each channel with an additional offset around 20kHz.  

For example, if the measured base frequencies are:  

```
ANTENNA 0: 530000 Hz  
ANTENNA 1: 614000 Hz  
ANTENNA 2: 520000 Hz  
ANTENNA 3: 510000 Hz  
```  

You should set:  

```c  
#define HET_GEN0_FREQ 550000  
#define HET_GEN1_FREQ 634000  
#define HET_GEN2_FREQ 540000  
#define HET_GEN3_FREQ 530000  
```  

I know this method is a bit tricky, but for now, it's the best approach I have. Improving the calibration process is on my to-do list for the future. ðŸ˜Š

## Oscillators

Program contains four independent oscillators mixed up by `dds` module. Each oscillator, get samples from wavetable list on proper frequency set by phase accumulator value.
For creating my own waves I use [Wave table generator](http://www.gaudi.ch/WaveGenerator/).
And my own scripts for sreated sine wave and some them combinations also.



## Building  

First, you need to clone the repository and initialize all submodules (FreeRTOS and CMSIS) using the following commands:  

```sh  
git submodule init  
git submodule update  
```  

There are several ways to build the project.  

### VS Code Extension (Recommended)  

Following the official SDK documentation, install the [Raspberry Pi Pico VS Code extension](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf#vscode-extension).  

Then, clone the repository and open it in Visual Studio Code. Next, import the project using the Raspberry Pi Pico badge. Select the project location and click the `Import` button. If you havenâ€™t installed the Pico SDK yet, the extension may take a few minutes to download and set it up.  

![Example of project import](doc/import_project.png)  

After reloading the window, the board configuration should be loaded as `polyTheremin_board`.  

### Using CMake  

You can also build the project manually using CMake. Create a build folder and run `cmake` inside it:  

```sh  
mkdir build  
cd build  
cmake ..  
make  
```  

## Contribution  

If you'd like to contribute to the project, your help is welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or create a new issue. I strive to write good code, but code reviews can provide valuable insights and improvements.
